# Titanic - ML classification
In this project I try my hand at data preprocessing and sklearn's different models.  
The aim of this project is to get as high a score as possible in [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) which provided the data.  

### WIP:
1. ~~Organizing and updating the code accordingly.~~
2. Separating data visualization and analysis from models.
3. Comparing different models and ensembles of models with no tuning.
4. Tuning best models.
5. Sending results and addressing over-fitting.
6. Understanding the differences between the models (In parallel to all others).
