# Titanic - ML classification
In this project I try my hand at data preprocessing and sklearn's different models.  
The aim of this project is to get as high a score as possible (legitimately) in [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) which provided the data.  
The current best pos. and score: 2204th out of 50,354, with a score of 0.78468.  

### This project is under renovations, I hope to integrate new theoretical knowledge and visualization techniques with previous trial and error.
Please bear with me as I am transitioning from academic life to job searching.
