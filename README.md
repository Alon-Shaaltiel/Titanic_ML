# Titanic - ML classification
In this project I try my hand at data preprocessing and sklearn's different models.  
The aim of this project is to get as high a score as possible (legitimately) in [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) which provided the data.  
The current best pos. and score: 2204th out of 50,354, with a score of 0.78468.  

### WIP:
1. ~~Organizing and updating the code accordingly.~~
2. ~~Separating data visualization and analysis from models.~~
3. ~~Finishing data analysis on provided features.~~
4. ~~Trying to produce condensed features (#Siblings -> "Has less than X Siblings")~~
5. ~~Preprocessing and encoding~~
6. ~~Comparing different models and ensembles of models with no tuning.~~
7. ~~Comparing feature importance in successful models (then back to 4).~~
8. ~~Tuning best models.~~
9. Sending results and addressing over-fitting.
